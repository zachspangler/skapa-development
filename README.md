# skapa-development
The purpose of this project is to create a personal 
website that will generate business for my freelance 
development projects. Skapa Development seeks to 
cost-efficiently solve small to medium businessâ€™ issues 
through the creation of web applications.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Really nice work on defining a clear purpose/audience/goal and Persona for your project. You've included enough detail here to begin to inform a design strategy for your project.

One thing that I'm missing in the Persona is more detail about what kinds of business problems William K. Frederick is having, and what sort of software solutions he's in the market for. The answer to this question may help you tighten the focus for your marketing, content, and design strategy for this project. Of course in the future your web presence and marketing will need to scale with your business and grow well beyond the scope of this one tiny class project, but for now the creation of an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that will help you achieve your immediate business goals after graduation might benefit from a tighter focus. That immediate goal might just be landing that first client. Just some thoughts.

Given your business ambitions and target market - a professional and polished presentation will be expected. Beyond wireframing, a professional polish can be achieved with just one or two good colors, a nice font, quality content, and maybe a nice image or two. It doesn't have to be complicated. :-)

Your project has been set up correctly, and your code looks great.

Really nice work here - I'm looking forward to seeing Skapa Development project take shape. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development on [Milestone 2a](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).

## Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
Nice work on the wireframes and content strategy. You've got a well defined vision for your project, and this will provide you with a clear "road map" for your development phase. The layout choices you've made will work very well with Bootstrap, and using the Bootstrap Grid to create this layout should be fairly straightforward. Coverage of Bootstrap begins the morning of 11/2.

Bootstrap UI components, built-ins, and other tools that may be helpful:
- [Navbar](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/navbar/)
- [Cards](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/card/) (might work well for the Chart Data)
- [Bootstrap Forms](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/components/forms/)
- [Image styling classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/content/images/)
- [Mix and Match Column Classes](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/#mix-and-match)
- [Nested Rows and Columns](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/layout/grid/#nesting)
- [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) for icons. (Not Bootstrap)
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com) (Also not Bootstrap)

Your charts can be created using the graphics software of your choice, and I would opt for SVG files if that's an export option. Reasoning: SVG supports small file sizes and excellent quality that scales.

If you have no past projects to include in the Projects section right now, you can always opt to exclude this section until you have content to feature.

Just a thought - but I'm wondering if leading in with "About Us" before "How It Works" might make more sense? Your call - just an idea.

Your desktop layout is solid. Let's talk about your mobile layout:

On the sm breakpoint and larger (>576px) I might consider placing the project thumbnails 2 x 2 instead of full width. I'm thinking that this may scale a bit better and reduce the scroll on smaller screens. 

The layout plan you have for the thumbnails and text under "How It Works" should be ok, but the length of the actual copy/content will be a big determining factor regarding what layout options are best. This section could get a little tricky, and you may need to nest a grid within a column here (see Nested Rows/Columns link above). When I read your Content Strategy I get the impression that this section is fairly important. I would consider layout and design choices carefully in this case - ensure that the design decisions highlight and support clear comprehension of your content.

Nice work - your Milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development on this project.

## Milestone2&beta;

Awesome Job On PWP Milestone2A. Other than a few content changes and cleaning up padding issues your PWP seems (minus contact form) polished and ready for final delivery. I do reccommend changing the font color for the process sesction (it can be very hard to read.

### TIER IV
