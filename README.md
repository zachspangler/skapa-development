# skapa-development
The purpose of this project is to create a personal 
website that will generate business for my freelance 
development projects. Skapa Development seeks to 
cost-efficiently solve small to medium businessâ€™ issues 
through the creation of web applications.

## Milestone 1 Feedback
Really nice work on defining a clear purpose/audience/goal and Persona for your project. You've included enough detail here to begin to inform a design strategy for your project.

One thing that I'm missing in the Persona is more detail about what kinds of business problems William K. Frederick is having, and what sort of software solutions he's in the market for. The answer to this question may help you tighten the focus for your marketing, content, and design strategy for this project. Of course in the future your web presence and marketing will need to scale with your business and grow well beyond the scope of this one tiny class project, but for now the creation of an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that will help you achieve your immediate business goals after graduation might benefit from a tighter focus. That immediate goal might just be landing that first client. Just some thoughts.

Given your business ambitions and target market - a professional and polished presentation will be expected. Beyond wireframing, a professional polish can be achieved with just one or two good colors, a nice font, quality content, and maybe a nice image or two. It doesn't have to be complicated. :-)

Your project has been set up correctly, and your code looks great.

Really nice work here - I'm looking forward to seeing Skapa Development project take shape. Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development on [Milestone 2a](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/milestone-two/).
