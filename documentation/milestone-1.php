		<h1>Personal Website Project by Zach Spangler</h1>
			<h2>Purpose, Audience, Goal</h2>
				<h4>The Idea</h4>
					<p>For My personal website project (PWP) I will be creating a website for the freelance development
						business I would like to start called, Skapa Development.</p>
				<h4>Purpose:</h4>
					<p>To generate business for my freelance development
						projects. My business will specialize in the creation of web applications
						to efficiently solve business issues.</p>
				<h4>Audience:</h4>
					<p>The audience for my website is small-medium business owners
						looking for ways to solve critical issues related
						primarily to internal business issues. </p>
				<h4>Goal:</h4>
					<p>My goal is to generate leads for freelance clients through the
						exhibition of my development work. Additionally, I believe if I can demonstrate
						the ability to create fully functional business, full-time employment opportunies will
						be more likely.
