		<h1>Personal Website Project by Zach Spangler</h1>
			<h2>Purpose, Audience, Goal</h2>
				<h4>The Website Idea</h4>
					<p>For my personal website project (PWP) I will be creating a website for the freelance development
						business I would like to start called, Skapa Development.</p>
				<h4>Purpose:</h4>
					<p>The primary purpose of this website is to generate business for my freelance development
						projects. My business will specialize in the creation of web applications
						to efficiently solve business issues.</p>
				<h4>Audience:</h4>
					<p>The audience for my website is small-medium business owners
						looking for ways to solve critical issues related
						primarily to internal business issues. </p>
				<h4>Goal:</h4>
					<p>The ultimate goal for this website is to generate leads for freelance clients through the
						exhibition of my development work. Additionally, I believe if I can demonstrate
						my ability to create fully functional websites that solve real business pain points for businesses,
						full-time employment opportunities will be more likely and this will serve as a sort of portfolio.

				<p><strong>Goal of Persona Internet Search:</strong> William is trying to find a solution for an
					issue impeding the efficiency of his internal business process. William is not concerned with
					taking a risk to solve a long-time business hurdle with the hope that this business efficiency
					will improve. He has come to the point where the hurdle is causing to much inefficiency/disgruntled
					employees or other business operations effects. William has a high understanding of how their industry
					and internal processes work and a clear understanding of what his business needs to solve this problem.

					on a regular basis. </p>

				application that will be developed and be willing to use technology that allows him to access a web
				browser (ideally a computer).</p>
			<p><strong>Attitude:</strong> Frustrated and looking for a solution but have found other service
				to be too expensive or non-existent for their particular use case.</p>
			<p><strong>Relevant Questions William will consider on my website:</strong></p>
				<ul>
					<li>Pricing: How can I afford this solution?</li>
					<li>Process of Development: How is this solution created?</li>
					<li>History: What have you created before?</li>
					<li>Trust: Who would I be working with? How can I trust you? What is your experience?</li>
				</ul>
