		<h1>Milestone 2</h1>
		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p>My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:</p>
		<p><strong>Header Nav Bar:</strong> Navigation Bar to each section of my page</p>
		<p><strong>Banner Image:</strong> This will be a banner image with the Skapa Development logo front and center</p>
		<p><strong>How It Works:</strong> The content strategy for this section is to provide a high level understanding of Skapa Development's unique business concept which focus on  a partnership structure which results in a lower cost of development, a custom development solution and the 7+ years of both enterprise and startup business knowledge I bring.</p>
		<p><strong>Chart Data:</strong> These charts will focus on potential cost savings of and benefits of using Skapa Development based on other projects outcomes and online research.</p>
		<p><strong>Projects:</strong> The projects section will feature three prominent development projects: The projects to be featured are TBD.</p>
		<p><strong>About Us:</strong> This section will focus on our company, I am thinking something like this: Our name comes from the Swedish verb meaning: to create. Merriam-Webster dictionary defines create as “to bring into existence.” At Skapa our goal is to create tools to eliminate headaches for business owners through the development of web applications.</p>
		<p><strong>Contact Us:</strong> This section will contain our contact form, the Skapa Development email (info@skapadevelopment.com). Additional links to my professional social media profiles will be included in the footer: LinkedIn, GitHub, and Facebook.</p>
