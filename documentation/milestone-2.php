		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
			<p>My content strategy for Skapa Development is to promote previous work and highlight the business concept
				by highlighting the lower cost of development, custom solutions and the 7+ years of business knowledge we
				with us.</p>
			<p>Our name comes from the Swedish verb meaning: to create. Merriam-Webster dictionary defines create as
				“to bring into existence.” At Skapa our goal is to created tools to eliminate headaches for small business
				owners through web development.</p>
			<p>We aim to cost effectively develop these tools for you through a unique partnership between you and Skapa.
				Our goal is to bring these tools to life without you having to spend tens of thousands of dollars on a
				custom solution.</p>
