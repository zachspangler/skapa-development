		<h1>Milestone 2</h1>
		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p>My site will be one page. The overall goal for the content on this site is to peak client interest without overwhelming the user with too much information. My website will consist of the following sections:</p>
		<p><strong>Header Nav Bar:</strong> This section will be a standard nav bar that will be linked to each section of my page and allow the user to quickly get to the section of their interest</p>
		<p><strong>Banner Image:</strong> This section will contain a banner image with the Skapa Development logo front and center</p>
		<p><strong>How It Works:</strong> The content strategy for this section is to provide a high level understanding of Skapa Development's unique business concept which focus on  a partnership structure which results in a lower cost of development, a custom development solution and the 7+ years of both enterprise and startup business knowledge I bring.</p>
		<p><strong>Chart Data:</strong> These charts will focus on potential cost savings of and benefits of using Skapa Development based on other projects outcomes and online research.</p>
		<p><strong>Projects:</strong> The projects section will feature three prominent development projects: The projects to be featured are TBD.</p>
		<p><strong>About Us:</strong> This section will focus on our company, I am thinking something like this: Our name comes from the Swedish verb meaning: to create. Merriam-Webster dictionary defines create as “to bring into existence.” At Skapa our goal is to create tools to eliminate headaches for business owners through the development of web applications.</p>
		<p><strong>Contact Us:</strong> This section will contain our contact form, the Skapa Development email (info@skapadevelopment.com). Additional links to my professional social media profiles will be included in the footer: LinkedIn, GitHub, and Facebook.</p>
