		<h1>Milestone 2</h1>
		<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
		<p>My content strategy for Skapa Development is to promote previous work and highlight the business concept by highlighting the lower cost of development, custom solutions and the 7+ years of business knowledge we with us.</p>
		<p>Our name comes from the Swedish verb meaning: to create. Merriam-Webster dictionary defines create as “to bring into existence.” At Skapa our goal is to create tools to eliminate headaches for business owners through the development of web applications.</p>
		<p>We aim to cost effectively develop these tools for you through a unique partnership between you and Skapa. Our goal is to bring these tools to life without you having to spend tens of thousands of dollars on a custom solution.</p>
